# Internet cookies
We do **not** directly use cookies on this website. A cookie is a small text file placed on your device / computer hard drive and helps determine how you use a website. 

However, adverts are displayed (see below) and Google Analytics is deployed to provide anonymous basic usage statics which, for the website, may store cookies to achieve this. Although not visible to us in Google Analytics reports, Google does capture user's IP addresses before aggregating them into geolocation reports. To protect your personal information [IP address anonymisation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) has been configured before IP data is sent to Google. Within OGCS, Google Analytics is used to help focus development of OGCS in areas that more significant impact by understanding which versions of OGCS and Outlook are in use, number of syncs performed and so forth. An option is available within OGCS to disable all telemetry.

# Error Reporting

At the discretion of users, any errors generated by OGCS can be automatically submitted to us for analysis. This is achieved by sending the 50 lines of logging preceeding the error to Google Stackdriver. Reports are anonymised, though some logging lines may include personal information; users are informed of this before enabling automatic reporting and can opt-out at any time.

# Fair & Transparent Privacy Explained
We have provided these explanations about user privacy and the way we use this website and OGCS to help promote a transparent and honest user privacy methodology.

# Sponsored links, affiliate tracking & commissions
Our website may contain adverts, sponsored and affiliate links on some pages. These are typically served through our advertising partners; Developer Media, Google Adsense or are self served through our own means. We only use trusted advertising partners who each have high standards of user privacy and security. However we do not control the actual adverts seen / displayed by our advertising partners. Our ad partners may collect data and use cookies for ad personalisation and measurement. Where ad preferences are requested as 'non-personalised' cookies may still be used for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and to combat fraud and abuse.

Clickable sponsored or affiliate links may be displayed as a website URL like this; [www.rugby.co.uk/rwc](#) or as a titled text link like this: [Rugby World Cup UK Times](#).

Clicking on any adverts, sponsored or affiliate links may track your actions by using a cookie saved to your device. You can read more about cookies on this website above. Your actions are usually recorded as a referral from our website by this cookie. In most cases we earn a very small commission from the advertiser or advertising partner, at no cost to you, whether you make a purchase on their website or not.

We use advertising partners in these ways to help generate an income from the website, which allows us to continue our work and provide you with the best overall experience and valued information.

If you have any concerns about this we suggest you do not click on any adverts, sponsored or affiliate links found throughout the website.
