# About
When Google removed their calendar synchronisation tool, I went in search of a replacement. As expected, there were a slew of paid solutions as well as freemium efforts with varying restrictions.  

After much searching, I happened across the early stages of [an open source project](https://outlookgooglesync.codeplex.com/) which had been abandoned but gave a good start to build and improve on.

## Mission
- Keep the software open source and free
- No restrictions in functionality
- Do one thing and one thing well - synchronise calendars!
- Maintain compatibility with all versions of Outlook from 2003

## Summary
Thousands of spare-time hours have now gone in to this project, and I'd like to think it's come a long way.

Beta releases should now be pretty stable, but if you find a bug [you can help]({{ site.github-repo }}/wiki/Reporting-Problems) squash it! :beetle:  

See the [history of enhancements](release-notes) and bug fixes thus far.
