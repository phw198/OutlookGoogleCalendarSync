### :eyes: The New "Outlook for Windows" Application
<div style="background-color: #ff6a001c; border: red; border-style: dashed; border-width: thin; padding: 5px; padding-left: 10px;"><font color="darkred">
   The "<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-windows">New Outlook for Windows</a>" application is not compatible with OGCS, as it no longer provides the COM interoperability that OGCS v2 was built upon.<br/>
   <a href="blog/2025/06/17/v3-release-candidate-available.html" style="background-color: yellow; text-decoration: underline;">A new v3 release of OGCS is now available</a> that no longer requires the Outlook client at all, and connects directly to Microsoft 365 cloud accounts.
