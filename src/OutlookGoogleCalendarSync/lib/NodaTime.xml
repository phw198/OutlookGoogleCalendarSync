            Exception thrown to indicate that the specified local date/time occurs twice
            in a particular time zone due to daylight saving time changes.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This occurs for transitions where the clock goes backward (usually by
            an hour). For example, suppose the time zone goes backward
            at 2am, so the second after 01:59:59 becomes 01:00:00. In that case,
            times such as 01:30:00 occur twice.
            </para>
            <para>
            This exception is used to indicate such problems, as they're usually
            not the same as other <see cref="T:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException" /> causes,
            such as entering "15" for a month number.
            </para>
            <para>
            In theory this isn't calendar-specific; the local value will be ambiguous in
            this time zone regardless of the calendar used. However, this exception is
            always created in conjunction with a specific calendar, which leads to a more
            natural way of examining its information and constructing an error message.

            <summary>
            Indicates that a type is immutable. After construction, the publicly visible
            state of the object will not change.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p>
            This attribute only applies to types, not fields:
            it's entirely feasible to have a readonly field of a mutable type, or a read/write
            field of an immutable type. In such cases for reference types (classes and interfaces)
            it's important to distinguish between the value of the variable (a reference) and the
            object it refers to. Value types are more complicated as in some cases the compiler
            will copy values before operating on them; however as all value types in Noda Time are
            immutable (aside from explictly implemented serialization operations) this rarely causes
            an issue.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some types may be publicly immutable, but contain privately mutable
            aspects, e.g. caches. If it proves to be useful to indicate the kind of
            immutability we're implementing, we can add an appropriate property to this
            attribute.

            Currently this excludes nested types, fields, and events - but it could be expanded to do so. Likewise

            This is a purely solar calendar with years starting at the vernal equinox.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>The Badíʿ calendar was developed and defined by the founders of the Bahá'í Faith in the mid to late
            1800's A.D. The first year in the calendar coincides with 1844 A.D. Years are labeled "B.E." for Bahá'í Era.</para>
            <para>A year consists of 19 months, each with 19 days. Each day starts at sunset. Years are grouped into sets
            of 19 "Unities" (Váḥid) and 19 Unities make up 1 "All Things" (Kull-i-Shay’).</para>
            <para>A period of days (usually 4 or 5, called Ayyám-i-Há) occurs between the 18th and 19th months. The length of this 
            period of intercalary days is solely determined by the date of the following vernal equinox. The vernal equinox is 
            a momentary point in time, so the "date" of the equinox is determined by the date (beginning 
            at sunset) in effect in Tehran, Iran at the moment of the equinox.</para>
            <para>In this Noda Time implementation, days start at midnight and lookup tables are used to determine vernal equinox dates.
            Ayyám-i-Há is internally modelled as extra days added to the 18th month. As a result, a few functions will
            not work as expected for Ayyám-i-Há, such as EndOfMonth.</para>

            Returns an Islamic, or Hijri, calendar system.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This returns a tablular calendar, rather than one based on lunar observation. This calendar is a
            lunar calendar with 12 months, each of 29 or 30 days, resulting in a year of 354 days (or 355 on a leap
            year).
            </para>
            <para>
            Year 1 in the Islamic calendar began on July 15th or 16th, 622 CE (Julian), thus
            Islamic years do not begin at the same time as Julian years. This calendar
            is not proleptic, as it does not allow dates before the first Islamic year.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are two basic forms of the Islamic calendar, the tabular and the
            observed. The observed form cannot easily be used by computers as it
            relies on human observation of the new moon. The tabular calendar, implemented here, is an
            arithmetic approximation of the observed form that follows relatively simple rules.
            </para>
            <para>You should choose an epoch based on which external system you wish
            to be compatible with. The epoch beginning on July 16th is the more common
            one for the tabular calendar, so using <see cref="F:NodaTime.Calendars.IslamicEpoch.Civil" />
            would usually be a logical choice. However, Windows uses July 15th, so
            if you need to be compatible with other Windows systems, you may wish to use
            <see cref="F:NodaTime.Calendars.IslamicEpoch.Astronomical" />. The fact that the Islamic calendar
            traditionally starts at dusk, a Julian day traditionally starts at noon,
            and all calendar systems in Noda Time start their days at midnight adds
            somewhat inevitable confusion to the mix, unfortunately.</para>
            <para>
            The tabular form of the calendar defines 12 months of alternately
            30 and 29 days. The last month is extended to 30 days in a leap year.
            Leap years occur according to a 30 year cycle. There are four recognised
            patterns of leap years in the 30 year cycle:

            <para>
            The Islamic, or Hijri, calendar is a lunar calendar of 12 months, each of 29 or 30 days.
            The calendar can be defined in either observational or tabular terms; 
            Noda Time implements a tabular calendar, where a pattern of leap years (in which the last month has
            an extra day) repeats every 30 years, according to one of the patterns within this enum.
            </para>
            <para>
            While the patterns themselves are reasonably commonly documented (see e.g.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabular_Islamic_calendar">Wikipedia</a>)
            there is little standardization in terms of naming the patterns. I hope the current names do not
            cause offence to anyone; suggestions for better names would be welcome.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Dates are usually identified within a calendar system by a calendar year, a month within that
            calendar year, and a day within that month. For example, the date of birth of Ada Lovelace can be identified
            within the Gregorian calendar system as the year 1815, the month December (12), and the day 10. However,
            dates can also be identified (again within a calendar system) by week-year, week and day-of-week. How
            that identification occurs depends on which rule you use - but again as an example, within the Gregorian
            calendar system, using the ISO-8601 week year rule, the date of Ada Lovelace's birth is week-year 1815,
            week 49, day-of-week Sunday.
            </para>
            <para>
            The calendar year of a date and the week-year of a date are the same in most rules for most dates, but aren't
            always. When they differ, it is usually because a day near the start of the calendar year is deemed to belong
            to the last week of the previous week-year - or conversely because a day near the end of the calendar year is
            deemed to belong to the first week of the following week-year. Some rules may be more radical -
            a UK tax year rule could number weeks from April 6th onwards, such that any date earlier than that in the calendar
            year would belong to the previous week-year.
            </para>
            <para>
            The mapping of dates into week-year, week and day-of-week is always relative to a specific calendar system.
            For example, years in the Hebrew calendar system vary very significantly in length due to leap months, and this
            is reflected in the number of weeks within the week-years - as low as 50, and as high as 55.
            </para>
            <para>
            This class allows conversions between the two schemes of identifying dates: <see cref="M:NodaTime.Calendars.IWeekYearRule.GetWeekYear(NodaTime.LocalDate)"/>
            and <see cref="M:NodaTime.Calendars.IWeekYearRule.GetWeekOfWeekYear(NodaTime.LocalDate)"/> allow the week-year and week to be obtained for a date, and
            <see cref="M:NodaTime.Calendars.IWeekYearRule.GetLocalDate(System.Int32,System.Int32,NodaTime.IsoDayOfWeek,NodaTime.CalendarSystem)"/> allows the reverse mapping. Note that
            the calendar system does not need to be specified in the former methods as a <see cref="T:NodaTime.LocalDate"/> already
            contains calendar information, and there is no method to obtain the day-of-week as that is not affected by the
            week year rule being used.

            definition, day 1 of the first week may be in the previous year. In ISO-8601,
            weeks always begin on a Monday, so this rule is equivalent to the first Thursday

            As of Noda Time 1.3, this is not specific to YearMonthDayCalculator - it can be used for

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Each entry in the cache is a 32-bit number. The "value" part of the entry consists of the
            number of days since the Unix epoch (negative for a value before the epoch). As Noda Time
            only supports a number of ticks since the Unix epoch of between long.MinValue and long.MaxValue,
            we only need to support a number of days in the range
            [long.MinValue / TicksPerDay, long.MaxValue / TicksPerDay] which is [-10675200, 10675200] (rounding
            away from 0). This value can be stored in 25 bits.
            </para>
            <para>
            The remaining 7 bits of the value are used for validation. For any given year, the bottom
            10 bits are used as the index into the cache (which is an array). The next 7 most significant
            bits are stored in the entry. So long as we have fewer than 17 significant bits in the year value,
            this will be a unique combination. A single validation value (the most highly positive value) is
            reserved to indicate an invalid entry. The cache is initialized with all entries invalid.
            This gives us a range of year numbers greater than [-60000, 60000] without any risk of collisions. By
            contrast, the ISO calendar years are in the range [-27255, 31195] - so we'd have to be dealing with a
            calendar with either very short years, or an epoch a long way ahead or behind the Unix epoch.

            The fact that each cache entry is only 32 bits means that we can safely use the cache from multiple
            threads without locking. 32-bit aligned values are guaranteed to be accessed atomically, so we know we'll
            never get the value for one year with the validation bits for another, for example.

            the change either creates a gap (a period of local time which never occurs in the time zone)
            or an ambiguity (a period of local time which occurs twice in the time zone). Mapping back from
            local time to an instant requires consideration of how these problematic times will be handled.

            <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">tz database</a> (also known as the IANA Time Zone database, or zoneinfo
            or Olson database), and the ability to convert .NET's own <see cref="T:System.TimeZoneInfo"/> format into a "native" Noda
            Time zone. Which of these is most appropriate for you to use will very much depend on your exact needs. The
            zoneinfo database is widely used outside Windows, and has more historical data than the Windows-provided
            information, but if you need to interoperate with other Windows systems by specifying time zone IDs, you may
            wish to stick to the Windows time zones.
            </para>
            <para>
            To obtain a <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> for a given timezone ID, use one of the methods on
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.IDateTimeZoneProvider"/> (and see <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZoneProviders"/> for access to the built-in
            providers). The UTC timezone is also available via the <see cref="P:NodaTime.DateTimeZone.Utc"/> property on this class.
            </para>
            <para>
            To obtain a <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> representing the system default time zone, you can either call
            <see cref="M:NodaTime.IDateTimeZoneProvider.GetSystemDefault"/> on a provider to obtain the <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> that
            the provider considers matches the system default time zone, or you can construct a
            <c>BclDateTimeZone</c> via <c>BclDateTimeZone.ForSystemDefault</c>, which returns a
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> that wraps the system local <see cref="T:System.TimeZoneInfo"/>. The latter will always
            succeed, but has access only to that information available via the .NET time zone; the former may contain more
            complete data, but may (in uncommon cases) fail to find a matching <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/>.
            Note that <c>BclDateTimeZone</c> is not available on the .NET Standard 1.3 build of Noda Time, so this fallback strategy can
            only be used with the desktop version.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that Noda Time does not require that <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> instances be singletons.
            Comparing two time zones for equality is not straightforward: if you care about whether two
            zones act the same way within a particular portion of time, use <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneEqualityComparer"/>.
            Additional guarantees are provided by <see cref="T:NodaTime.IDateTimeZoneProvider"/> and <see cref="M:NodaTime.DateTimeZone.ForOffset(NodaTime.Offset)"/>.

            </remarks>
            <threadsafety>
            All time zone implementations within Noda Time are immutable and thread-safe.
            See the thread safety section of the user guide for more information.
            It is expected that third party implementations will be immutable and thread-safe as well:
            code within Noda Time assumes that it can hand out time zones to any thread without any concerns. If you
            implement a non-thread-safe time zone, you will need to use it extremely carefully. We'd recommend that you
            avoid this if possible.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            A duration is a length of time defined by an integral number of nanoseconds.
            Although durations are usually used with a positive number of nanoseconds, negative durations are valid, and may occur
            naturally when e.g. subtracting a later <see cref="T:NodaTime.Instant"/> from an earlier one.
            </para>
            <para>
            A duration represents a fixed length of elapsed time along the time line that occupies the same amount of
            time regardless of when it is applied. In contrast, <see cref="T:NodaTime.Period"/> represents a period of time in
            calendrical terms (years, months, days, and so on) that may vary in elapsed time when applied.
            </para>
            <para>
            In general, use <see cref="T:NodaTime.Duration"/> to represent durations applied to global types like <see cref="T:NodaTime.Instant"/>
            and <see cref="T:NodaTime.ZonedDateTime"/>; use <c>Period</c> to represent a period applied to local types like
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.LocalDateTime"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The range of valid values of a <c>Duration</c> is greater than the span of time supported by Noda Time - so for
            example, subtracting one <see cref="T:NodaTime.Instant"/> from another will always give a valid <c>Duration</c>. The range
            is also greater than that of <see cref="T:System.TimeSpan"/> (<see cref="F:System.Int64.MinValue" /> ticks to <see cref="F:System.Int64.MaxValue"/> ticks).
            See the user guide for more details of the exact range, but it is not expected that this will ever be exceeded in normal code.
            </para>
            <para>
            Various operations accept or return a <see cref="T:System.Double"/>, in-keeping with durations often being natural lengths
            of time which are imprecisely measured anyway. The implementation of these operations should never result in a not-a-number
            or infinite value, nor do any operations accept not-a-number or infinite values. Additionally, operations involving
            <c>Double</c> have initially been implemented fairly naïvely; it's possible that future releases will improve the accuracy
            or performance (or both) of various operations.

            if we see an invariant name, that *isn't* deliberately a genitive month name. A non-invariant culture
            which decided to have genitive month names exactly matching the invariant ones would be distinctly odd.

            Mono 3.0.6 has an exciting and different bug, where all the abbreviated genitive month names are just numbers ("1" etc).

            <see cref="T:NodaTime.IClock"/> is intended for use anywhere you need to have access to the current time.
            Although it's not strictly incorrect to call <c>SystemClock.Instance.GetCurrentInstant()</c> directly,
            in the same way as you might call <see cref="P:System.DateTime.UtcNow"/>, it's strongly discouraged
            as a matter of style for production code. We recommend providing an instance of <see cref="T:NodaTime.IClock"/>
            to anything that needs it, which allows you to write tests using the fake clock in the NodaTime.Testing

            Callers should be aware that this method will throw <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.DateTimeZoneNotFoundException"/> if no matching
            time zone is found. For the built-in Noda Time providers, this is unlikely to occur in practice (assuming
            the system is using a standard Windows time zone), but can occur even then, if no mapping is found. The TZDB
            source contains mappings for almost all Windows system time zones, but a few (such as "Mid-Atlantic Standard Time")
            are unmappable.

            <para>
            If it is necessary to handle this case, callers can construct a
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.BclDateTimeZone"/> via <see cref="M:NodaTime.TimeZones.BclDateTimeZone.ForSystemDefault"/>, which returns a
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.DateTimeZone"/> that wraps the system local <see cref="T:System.TimeZoneInfo"/>, and which always
            succeeds. Note that <c>BclDateTimeZone</c> is not available on the .NET Standard 1.3 build of Noda Time, so

            LocalDate is an immutable struct representing a date within the calendar,

            <para>
            Values can freely be compared for equality: a value in a different calendar system is not equal to
            a value in a different calendar system. However, ordering comparisons (either via the <see cref="M:NodaTime.LocalDate.CompareTo(NodaTime.LocalDate)"/> method
            or via operators) fail with <see cref="T:System.ArgumentException"/>; attempting to compare values in different calendars
            almost always indicates a bug in the calling code.

            Values can freely be compared for equality: a value in a different calendar system is not equal to
            a value in a different calendar system. However, ordering comparisons (either via the <see cref="M:NodaTime.LocalDateTime.CompareTo(NodaTime.LocalDateTime)"/> method
            or via operators) fail with <see cref="T:System.ArgumentException"/>; attempting to compare values in different calendars
            almost always indicates a bug in the calling code.

        <member name="T:NodaTime.Offset">
            <summary>
            An offset from UTC in seconds. A positive value means that the local time is
            ahead of UTC (e.g. for Europe); a negative value means that the local time is behind
            UTC (e.g. for America).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Offsets are always in the range of [-18, +18] hours. (Note that the ends are inclusive,
            so an offset of 18 hours can be represented, but an offset of 18 hours and one second cannot.)
            This allows all offsets within TZDB to be represented. The BCL <see cref="T:System.DateTimeOffset"/> type
            only allows offsets up to 14 hours, which means some historical data within TZDB could not be
            represented.
            </para>
            <para>Offsets are represented with a granularity of one second. This allows all offsets within TZDB
            to be represented. It is possible that it could present issues to some other time zone data sources,
            but only in very rare historical cases (or fictional ones).</para>

            A local date and time in a particular calendar system, combined with an offset from UTC. This is
            broadly similar to <see cref="T:System.DateTimeOffset" /> in the BCL.

            <para>
            A value of this type unambiguously represents both a local time and an instant on the timeline,
            but does not have a well-defined time zone. This means you cannot reliably know what the local
            time would be five minutes later, for example. While this doesn't sound terribly useful, it's very common
            in text representations.

            A <see cref="T:NodaTime.Period"/> contains a set of properties such as <see cref="P:NodaTime.Period.Years"/>, <see cref="P:NodaTime.Period.Months"/>, and so on
            that return the number of each unit contained within this period. Note that these properties are not normalized in
            any way by default, and so a <see cref="T:NodaTime.Period"/> may contain values such as "2 hours and 90 minutes". The
            <see cref="M:NodaTime.Period.Normalize"/> method will convert equivalent periods into a standard representation.

            Periods can contain negative units as well as positive units ("+2 hours, -43 minutes, +10 seconds"), but do not
            differentiate between properties that are zero and those that are absent (i.e. a period created as "10 years"
            and one created as "10 years, zero months" are equal periods; the <see cref="P:NodaTime.Period.Months"/> property returns zero in
            both cases).

            Periods operate on calendar-related types such as
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.LocalDateTime" /> whereas <see cref="T:NodaTime.Duration"/> operates on instants
            on the time line. (Note that although <see cref="T:NodaTime.ZonedDateTime" /> includes both concepts, it only supports

            Certain periods can't naturally be compared without more context - how "one month" compares to
            "30 days" depends on where you start. In order to compare two periods, the returned comparer
            effectively adds both periods to the "base" specified by <paramref name="baseDateTime"/> and compares
            the results. In some cases this arithmetic isn't actually required - when two periods can be
            converted to durations, the comparer uses that conversion for efficiency.

            <remarks>
            Months and years are unchanged
            (as they can vary in length), but weeks are multiplied by 7 and added to the
            Days property, and all time properties are normalized to their natural range.
            Subsecond values are normalized to millisecond and "nanosecond within millisecond" values.
            So for example, a period of 25 hours becomes a period of 1 day
            and 1 hour. A period of 1,500,750,000 nanoseconds becomes 1 second, 500 milliseconds and
            750,000 nanoseconds. Aside from months and years, either all the properties
            end up positive, or they all end up negative. "Week" and "tick" units in the returned period are always 0.

            <para>
            This normally occurs for spring transitions, where the clock goes forward
            (usually by an hour). For example, suppose the time zone goes forward
            at 2am, so the second after 01:59:59 becomes 03:00:00. In that case,
            local times such as 02:30:00 never occur.
            </para>
            <para>
            This exception is used to indicate such problems, as they're usually
            not the same as other <see cref="T:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException" /> causes,
            such as entering "15" for a month number.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that it is possible (though extremely rare) for a whole day to be skipped due to a time zone transition,
            so this exception may also be thrown in cases where no local time is valid for a particular local date. (For
            example, Samoa skipped December 30th 2011 entirely, transitioning from UTC-10 to UTC+14 at midnight.)

            A builder for composite patterns.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A composite pattern is a combination of multiple patterns. When parsing, these are checked
            in the order in which they are added to the builder with the <see cref="M:NodaTime.Text.CompositePatternBuilder`1.Add(NodaTime.Text.IPattern{`0},System.Func{`0,System.Boolean})"/>
            method, by trying to parse and seeing if the result is a successful one. When formatting,
            the patterns are checked in the reverse order, using the predicate provided along with the pattern
            when calling <c>Add</c>. The intention is that patterns are added in "most precise first" order,
            and the predicate should indicate whether it can fully represent the given value - so the "less precise"
            (and therefore usually shorter) pattern can be used first.

            is supported by all Noda Time calendar systems, if a pattern is created with a different
            template value and then this method is called with a calendar system which doesn't support that
            date, an exception will be thrown. Additionally, if the pattern only specifies some date fields,
            it's possible that the new template value will not be suitable for all values.

            Care should be taken in two (relatively rare) scenarios. Although the default template value
            is supported by all Noda Time calendar systems, if a pattern is created with a different
            template value and then this method is called with a calendar system which doesn't support that
            date, an exception will be thrown. Additionally, if the pattern only specifies some date fields,
            it's possible that the new template value will not be suitable for all values.

            The minutes part of the offset is always included, but any sub-minute component
            of the offset is lost. An offset of zero is formatted as 'Z', but all of 'Z', '+00:00' and '-00:00' are parsed
            the same way. The RFC 3339 meaning of '-00:00' is not supported by Noda Time.
            Note that parsing is case-sensitive (so 'T' and 'Z' must be upper case).
            This pattern corresponds to a custom pattern of
            "HH':'mm':'ss;FFFFFFFFFo&lt;Z+HH:mm&gt;".

            A "normalizing" pattern which abides by the ISO-8601 duration format as far as possible.
            Weeks are added to the number of days (after multiplying by 7). Time units are normalized
            (extending into days where necessary), and fractions of seconds are represented within the
            seconds part. Unlike ISO-8601, which pattern allows for negative values within a period.

            <summary>
            An implementation of IZoneIntervalMap that delegates to an original map, except for where the result of a
            ZoneInterval lookup has the given daylight name. In that case, a new ZoneInterval is built with the same
            wall offset (and start/end instants etc), but with a savings of 1 hour. This is only used to work around TimeZoneInfo
            adjustment rules with a daylight saving of 0 which are really trying to fake a more comprehensive solution.
            (This is currently only seen on Mono on Linux...)
            This addresses https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/issues/746.
            If TimeZoneInfo had sufficient flexibility to use different names for different periods of time, we'd have
            another problem, as some "daylight names" don't always mean daylight - e.g. "BST" = British Summer Time and British Standard Time.
            In this case, the limited nature of TimeZoneInfo works in our favour.

            a node therefore has to contain enough intervals to completely represent that period.
            
            If another call is made which maps to the same cache entry number but is for a different
            period, the existing hash entry is simply overridden.

            As with other IDs, this should largely be treated as an opaque string, but the current method for

            The CLDR mapping file usually lags behind the TZDB file somewhat - partly because the

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Each mapping consists of a single Windows time zone ID and a single

            <para>
            Mappings for a single Windows system time zone can appear multiple times
            in this list, in different territories. For example, "Central Standard Time"
            maps to different TZDB zones in different countries (the US, Canada, Mexico) and
            even within a single territory there can be multiple zones. Every Windows system time zone covered within
            this collection has a "primary" entry with a territory code of "001" (which is the value of
            <see cref="F:NodaTime.TimeZones.Cldr.MapZone.PrimaryTerritory"/>) and a single corresponding TZDB zone. 
            </para>
            <para>This collection is not guaranteed to cover every Windows time zone. Some zones may be unmappable
            (such as "Mid-Atlantic Standard Time") and there can be a delay between a new Windows time zone being introduced
            and it appearing in CLDR, ready to be used by Noda Time. (There's also bound to be a delay between it appearing
            in CLDR and being used in your production system.) In practice however, you're unlikely to wish to use a time zone
            which isn't covered here.</para>

            <para>
            The interface presumes that the available time zones are static; there is no mechanism for 
            updating the list of available time zones. Any time zone ID that is returned in <see cref="M:NodaTime.TimeZones.IDateTimeZoneSource.GetIds"/> 
            must be resolved by <see cref="M:NodaTime.TimeZones.IDateTimeZoneSource.ForId(System.String)"/> for the life of the source.
            </para>
            <para>
            Implementations need not cache time zones or the available time zone IDs. 
            Caching is typically provided by <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.DateTimeZoneCache"/>, which most consumers should use instead of
            consuming <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.IDateTimeZoneSource"/> directly in order to get better performance.
            </para>
            <para>
            It is expected that any exceptions thrown are implementation-specific; nothing is explicitly
            specified in the interface. Typically this would be unusual to the point that callers would not
            try to catch them; any implementation which may break in ways that are sensible to catch should advertise
            this clearly, so that clients will know to handle the exceptions appropriately. No wrapper exception
            type is provided by Noda Time to handle this situation, and code in Noda Time does not try to catch
            such exceptions.

            In cases where we can't get a zone mapping directly, we try to work out a good fit
            by checking the transitions within the next few years.
            This can happen if the Windows data isn't up-to-date, or if we're on a system where
            TimeZoneInfo.Local.Id just returns "local", or if TimeZoneInfo.Local is a custom time
            zone for some reason. We return null if we don't get a 70% hit rate.
            We look at all transitions in all canonical IDs for the next 5 years.
            Heuristically, this seems to be good enough to get the right results in most cases.
            This method used to only be called in the PCL build in 1.x, but it seems reasonable enough to

            Options to use when comparing time zones for equality. Each option makes the comparison more restrictive.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            By default, the comparer only compares the wall offset (total of standard offset and any daylight saving offset)
            at every instant within the interval over which the comparer operates. In practice, this is done by comparing each
            <see cref="T:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneInterval"/> which includes an instant within the interval (using <see cref="M:NodaTime.DateTimeZone.GetZoneIntervals(NodaTime.Interval)"/>).
            For most purposes, this is all that's required: from the simple perspective of a time zone being just a function from instants to local time,
            the default option of <see cref="F:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneEqualityComparer.Options.OnlyMatchWallOffset"/> effectively checks that the function gives the same result across the two time
            zones being compared, for any given instant within the interval.
            </para>
            <para>
            It's possible for a time zone to have a transition from one <c>ZoneInterval</c> to another which doesn't adjust the offset: it
            might just change the name, or the balance between standard offset to daylight saving offset. (As an example, at midnight local
            time on October 27th 1968, the Europe/London time zone went from a standard offset of 0 and a daylight saving offset of 1 hour
            to a standard offset of 1 and a daylight saving offset of 0... which left the clocks unchanged.) This transition is irrelevant
            to the default options, so the two zone intervals involved are effectively coalesced.
            </para>
            <para>
            The options available change what sort of comparison is performed - which can also change which zone intervals can be coalesced. For
            example, by specifying just the <see cref="F:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneEqualityComparer.Options.MatchAllTransitions"/> option, you would indicate that even though you don't care about the name within a zone
            interval or how the wall offset is calculated, you do care about the fact that there was a transition at all, and when it occurred.
            With that option enabled, zone intervals are never coalesced and the transition points within the operating interval are checked.
            </para>
            <para>Similarly, the <see cref="F:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneEqualityComparer.Options.MatchStartAndEndTransitions"/> option is the only one where instants outside the operating interval are
            relevant. For example, consider a comparer which operates over the interval [2000-01-01T00:00:00Z, 2011-01-01T00:00:00Z). Normally,
            anything that happens before the year 2000 (UTC) would be irrelevant - but with this option enabled, the transitions of the first and last zone
            intervals are part of the comparison... so if one time zone has a zone interval 1999-09-01T00:00:00Z to 2000-03-01T00:00:00Z and the other has
            a zone interval 1999-10-15T00:00:00Z to 2000-03-01T00:00:Z, the two zones would be considered unequal, despite the fact that the only instants observing
            the difference occur outside the operating interval.

            Instead of only comparing wall offsets, the standard/savings split is also considered. So when this
            option is used, two zones which both have a wall offset of +2 at one instant would be considered
            unequal if one of those offsets was +1 standard, +1 savings and the other was +2 standard with no daylight
            saving.

                  The local time occurs twice in the target time zone, due to the offset from UTC
                  changing. This usually occurs for an autumnal daylight saving transition, where the clocks
                  are put back by an hour. If the clocks change from 2am to 1am for example, then 1:30am occurs
                  twice - once before the transition and once afterwards.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            A year offset defines a way of determining an offset into a year based on certain criteria.
            The most basic is the month of the year and the day of the month. If only these two are
            supplied then the offset is always the same day of each year. The only exception is if the
            day is February 29th, then it only refers to those years that have a February 29th.
            </para>
            <para>
            If the day of the week is specified then the offset determined by the month and day are
            adjusted to the nearest day that falls on the given day of the week. If the month and day
            fall on that day of the week then nothing changes. Otherwise the offset is moved forward or
            backward up to 6 days to make the day fall on the correct day of the week. The direction the
            offset is moved is determined by the <see cref="P:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneYearOffset.AdvanceDayOfWeek"/> property.
            </para>
            <para>
            Finally the <see cref="P:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneYearOffset.Mode"/> property deterines whether the <see cref="P:NodaTime.TimeZones.ZoneYearOffset.TimeOfDay"/> value
            is added to the calculated offset to generate an offset within the day.

            This type is naive: comparisons are performed assuming that a larger month number
            always comes after a smaller month number, etc.
            This is suitable for most, but not all, calendar systems.

            The month is represented in bits 12-16.

            This type does not implement IComparable[YearMonthDayCalendar] as it turns out it doesn't need to:
            comparisons are always done through the calendar system, which uses YearMonthDay instead. We could potentially
            optimize by bypassing the calendar and embedding knowledge of calendars which have "odd" month numberings
            in here, but it would be a bit of a design smell.
            
            Equality is easily tested, however, as it can check for calendar equality.

            Tells code analysis engine if the parameter is completely handled
            when the invoked method is on stack. If the parameter is a delegate,
            indicates that delegate is executed while the method is executed.
            If the parameter is an enumerable, indicates that it is enumerated
            while the method is executed
