            A field annotation that maps fields in the initial request message
            (the one which started the LRO) to their counterparts in the polling
            request message. For non-standard LRO, the polling response may be missing
            some of the information needed to make a subsequent polling request. The

            to. The string value of the annotation corresponds to the name of the

            If the operation was created with a different major version of the service API than expected,
            the metadata and response values may not be of the expected type. There are three approaches to handling this:

            <remarks>
            Manages long-running operations with an API service.
            
            When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
            to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this
            interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
            operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
            Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
            returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
            so developers can have a consistent client experience.

            Manages long-running operations with an API service.
            
            When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
            to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this
            interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
            operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
            Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
            returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
            so developers can have a consistent client experience.

             Manages long-running operations with an API service.
            
             When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
             to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this
             interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
             operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
             Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
             returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
             so developers can have a consistent client experience.
