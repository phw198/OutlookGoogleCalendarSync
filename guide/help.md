# Help

This tab contains a brief guide to help get started using OGCS. A slightly more detailed version can be found in the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart).

If you have found a problem or bug, there is also some information on how to report this to the developer, which is included below:
* set the [logging level](appbehaviour#logging) to `DEBUG`
* reproduce the problem
* update an existing issue or create a new [issue on GitHub]({{ site.github-repo }}/issues)
* attach your OGcalsync.log file

<br/>
See the [Project Wiki]({{ site.github-repo }}/wiki/Reporting-Problems) for more details around problem reporting.
