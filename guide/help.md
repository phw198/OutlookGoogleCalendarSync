# Help

This tab contains a brief guide to help get started using OGCS. A slightly more detailed version can be found in the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart).

Use the forward and back buttons above to navigate through the user guide, or press F1 on any screen in the application to view the associated help page directly.

If you have found a problem or bug, there is also some information on how to report this to the developer, which is included below:
* [upgrade](https://github.com/phw198/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/wiki/Upgrading) to the latest alpha release
* set the [logging level](appbehaviour#logging) to `DEBUG`
* reproduce the problem
* update an existing issue or create a new [issue on GitHub]({{ site.github-repo }}/issues)
* attach your OGcalsync.log file

<br/>
See the [Project Wiki]({{ site.github-repo }}/wiki/Reporting-Problems) for more details around problem reporting.
